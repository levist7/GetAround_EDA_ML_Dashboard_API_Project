Getaround is an online rental car rental service but in an Airbnb way. When renting a car, users have to complete a checkin flow at the beginning of the rental and a checkout flow at the end of the rental in order to:

*  Assess the state of the car and notify other parties of pre-existing damages or damages that occurred during the rental.
*  Compare fuel levels.
*  Measure how many kilometers were driven.
*  Ensure checkin and checkout policies

The **goal** is to resolve those issues and give insights on implementing a minimum delay between two rentals. A car wonâ€™t be displayed in the search results if the requested checkin or checkout times are too close from an already booked rental. It can solve the late checkout issue but may hurt Getaround/owners revenues.

**Deliverabes availabe**  ðŸ“¬:

1-  A dashboard in production (accessible via a web page above)

2-  An documented online API on Heroku server containing /predict endpoint that respect the technical descriptions. 

3-  Exploratory data analysis on Getaround data and test of various machine learning models
